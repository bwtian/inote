* Avoid Conflicting
** Avoid conflicts
1. Just Keep 1 Dropbox Software installed on 1 PC:
   - Whatever you have dual boot or Virtual machine.
   - Which usually for surf internet
2. Make sure that the files are fully synchronized before and after editing
     the files on any computer
3. If the files need editing by one person only,
   - putting passwords
4. If two or more people need to work on same files
   - Develop protocols
   - Make contact info in the folder
   - Rename before edit and rename it back to original name when finished

** Delete conflicts
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -name "*conflicted*" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
#+END_SRC

* QA
** cannot monitor file system
The Linux version of the Dropbox desktop application is limited from monitoring more than 10000 folders by default. Anything over that is not watched and, therefore, ignored when syncing. There's an easy fix for this. Open a terminal and enter the following:
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; sudo sysctl -p
This command will tell your system to watch up to 100000 folders. Once the command is entered and you enter your password, Dropbox will immediately resume syncing.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; sudo sysctl -p
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file ../  


#+END_SRC

* Dropbox Tips
